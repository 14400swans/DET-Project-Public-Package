# DET Project â€“ Emotion Analysis Pioneer

## About
I am developing DET Project, a unique platform that combines multiple emotion analysis methods with life guidance.  
Unlike traditional apps focusing on a single method, DET integrates:

- Facial emotion recognition (camera-based)
- Voice emotion analysis (microphone-based)
- Text and journaling emotion feedback
- Color-based emotional representations
- Merged logs (unified emotion_log.json)
- PDF emotion reports for personal growth
- Career and rehabilitation guidance based on diagnosis and symptoms

## Vision
The goal is not only to analyze emotions but to provide direction, meaning, and rehabilitation paths in life.  
This makes DET Project more than a tool â€” itâ€™s a **new approach to mental wellbeing and life planning**.

## Status
- Prototype under development in VS Code
- Local, privacy-first approach
- Includes journaling, feedback, 3D visualization, and export features
